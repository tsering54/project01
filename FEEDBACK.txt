FEEDBACK:

Well done!

+1 Extra for implementation of class FoothillTunesStore groupSongsByGenre() method
          and class FoothillTunesStore printNumOfSongsInEachGenre() method
   However, your implementation does not complete in a reasonable amount of time (< 1 min)
   for our small data set.
   The slow down may be due to the following line:
         tunes.add(dataSet.getArrayOfSongs()[i]);
   Why are you getting an array of songs during every iteration of the for loop?



-0 Good detailed README. 
   However, for future, place README.txt and RUN.txt at top level directory under project folder
   as required by project description. That way I can easily identify where the rest of
   of the files are in your submission. 
   Next time minus one for this.


-0 Javadocs missing. For future, make sure to include javadocs. The module Introductions has a 
   short tutorial under “Example Program Submission” on how to create the Javadocs in Eclipse. 


-0 Unless you can justify FoothillTunesStore, etc. should not be in MyTunes.java file,
	define them  in their own .java file.
	For more details see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/managingfiles.html
    Next time minus for every such class.

   
    	
-Bita.
